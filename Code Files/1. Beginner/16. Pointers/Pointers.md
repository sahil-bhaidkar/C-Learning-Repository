**Memory Management**

The script demonstrates various ways to manage memory in C++, including:

* **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The `createArray` function allocates memory for an array on the heap using `new`.
This is a common way to create arrays in C++.
* **Static Memory Allocation**: The `arr1` array is allocated statically, which means its size is known at compile
time. However, this can lead to issues if the array needs to be resized or if it's used with dynamic memory
allocation.
* **Manual Memory Management**: The script shows how to manually manage memory using pointers and deallocation
functions like `delete`.

**Pointer Concepts**

The script covers various pointer concepts, including:

* **Variable Pointers**: A variable is a pointer that stores the address of another variable. For example, `int*
ptr;` declares a pointer named `ptr` that points to an integer variable.
* **Array Pointers**: An array is a type of pointer where each element points to a different memory location. For
example, `int arr[10];` creates an array of 10 integers, where each element is pointed to by an array element
(e.g., `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, etc.).
* **Pointer Arithmetic**: Pointer arithmetic allows you to access elements of a pointer using its address. For
example, `*(ptr + i)` accesses the element at the address stored in `ptr` plus `i`.
* **Dereferencing Operators**: Dereference operators like `*` and `&` are used to extract values from pointers or
arrays.

**Pointer Types**

The script covers various pointer types, including:

* **Basic Pointers**: A basic pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. In this case,
it's declared as `int* ptr;`.
* **Array Pointers**: An array pointer is a type of pointer where each element points to an array.
* **Function Pointers**: Function pointers are variables that store the address of a function. They can be used as
arguments or return values for functions.

**Pointer Operators**

The script demonstrates various pointer operators, including:

* **Arithmetic Operators**: Arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*` are applied to two pointers to perform
operations on their addresses.
* **Comparison Operators**: Comparison operators like `==`, `<`, and `>` are used to compare the values stored in
pointers.

**Dereferencing**

The script covers various dereference techniques, including:

* **Basic Dereferences**: Basic dereferences like `*ptr` extract the value from a pointer.
* **Array Dereferences**: Array dereferences like `arr[i]` access the element at the address stored in an array
element.

**Assignment and Copying**

The script demonstrates how to assign values to arrays using assignment operators, as well as how to copy values
between arrays using constructors or assignment operators.

**Best Practices**

The script covers several best practices for working with pointers in C++, including:

* **Using Smart Pointers**: Smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` help manage memory
automatically.
* **Avoiding Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Avoid dynamic memory allocation unless necessary to prevent issues with
memory management.
* **Using Container Classes**: Using container classes like `std::vector` can simplify memory management for many
use cases.

**Code Organization**

The script demonstrates good code organization practices, including:

* **Separating Concerns**: The script separates concerns into different functions, each with its own
responsibility (e.g., creating an array, printing it, etc.).
* **Using Functions**: Functions are used to encapsulate code and promote modularity.
* **Commenting Code**: Comments are used to explain the purpose of the code and make it easier for others to
understand.
